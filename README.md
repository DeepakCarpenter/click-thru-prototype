# Click-Thru Prototype

A Sketch plugin that creates a HTML click-through prototype of a responsive website design so you can give your clients an idea what the website will look like.

## Installation

To install, download the zip file and double-click on `Click-Thru Prototype.sketchplugin`. The commands will show up under `Plugins > Click-Thru Prototype`. To see it in action, open `demo.sketch` in the zip file and then select `Plugins > Click-Thru Prototype > Export to HTML`.

## Usage

You can create links between artboards, add external links or show a JavaScript dialog. When you're finished adding these you can generate a HTML website which you can upload to a server to show to your client by selecting `Export to HTML`. 
 
The plugin can handle responsive design, you just need to start your artboards with the same name e.g. `homepage`, `homepage tablet`, `homepage mobile`. When you change the width of your browser it will show a different artboard in the exported website.

On mobile you will want to show a mobile menu rather than the normal horizontal menu. To do this you need to select which layer is the button that shows the menu by selecting `Set Mobile Menu Button`, and which layer is the mobile menu by selecting `Set Mobile Menu`.
